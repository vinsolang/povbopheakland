                        At Pov Bopheak Land & Home Co., Ltd., we believe that real estate is about far more than
                        property alone,
                        it is about people, trust, and the future we help shape together. Cambodia, and particularly
                        Phnom Penh,
                        is entering a pivotal phase of growth. As the city continues to develop into a modern and
                        dynamic regional center,
                        the real estate market presents significant opportunities. At the same time, this progress
                        requires responsibility, transparency,
                        and a long-term perspective. Pov Bopheak Land & Home Co., Ltd. was founded on these principles.

                        From the outset, our shared vision has been clear: to connect clients with real estate
                        opportunities that are
                        not only attractive today, but sustainable and valuable for the long term. We focus on carefully
                        selected condominiums,
                        landed properties, land plots, and exclusive developments that meet high standards of location,
                        construction quality,
                        legal clarity, and investment potential.

                        What truly distinguishes our company is our belief in relationships over transactions.

                        or investors pursuing strategic returns, we take the time to understand individual goals and
                        provide professional,
                        honest guidance at every stage of the process. Trust is built through consistency,
                        transparency, and accountability, and we treat that trust as our most valuable asset.
